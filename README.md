## A simple and stupid method for loop closure detection in 3D LIDAR data:

Rohling T, Mack J, Schulz D. A fast histogram-based similarity measure for detecting loop closures in 3-D LIDAR data[C]// Ieee/rsj International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems. IEEE, 2015:736-741.

## Test Data:

Our own data in YuQuan Campus, from Velodyen VLP16.

##Thanks:

Ethz_asl for libpointmatcher

##IS GOING ON

Add the histogram of Intensity, and the rings of velodyne points
